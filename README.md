Project Estimation System - PES
===============================

Introduction
------------

This project is a small application that allows to estimate software project based on:

1. Complexity of the methdos
2. Number on parameters
3. Type of mehtod/coding 

The project is divided in tasks. The task in subtask and the subtask can have methods. 
Subtask time can be defined by the user but can also be calculated based on the defined variables applied on every method.

The method/coding type define the calculation to be executed, and the system will calcualte the time 
for: Methods, Subtask, Task and the project.
